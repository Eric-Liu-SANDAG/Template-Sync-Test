# Template Test

A repository to test the functionality of https://github.com/marketplace/actions/actions-template-sync

The GH Action is currently set up to run on any commit in THIS repository, so this is a dummy commit to see if the sync PR is properly created

Had to enable a setting to allow GH Actions to create and approve PRs

Added second test file just in case
